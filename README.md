# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page

![Design preview for the Recipe page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luiza Moretti and I am starting on the world of Front-end!

Thanks for checking out this coding challenge. I've got it from Frontend Mentor website, so you should check it out too.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a given recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The design can be seen on the top of this page :P

## Where to find everything

All design used are inside the `/design` folder, both mobile and desktop verisons.

- All the assets required are in the `/assets` folder.
- There are some font files in the `/assets` folder as well, but it is possible to incorporate google fonts.
- The `style-guide.md` file contains the information needed to complete the project, such as color palette and fonts.

## My timeline

All the design images are in `.jpg` so I'll have to use my skills to build the page as similar as the given design as I can.

Since I am just starting to learn the basic tools to web development, I decided to use only HTML, CSS and JS. This can be changed at any time, and I will add here the changes as I go.

There is a `.HTML` file that contains a basic structure and the recipe itself.
I have decided to work from top to bottom on this project, so I analysed the design and the `.HTML` file to decide where to begin. I also decided to go *Mobile first*.

I started with the image on the header of the page and sized it to the mobile widht. I had a bit of dificult since the img wouldn't sized properly, but it worked out in the end.

I also stylised the name of the recipe with the proper font-family and adjusted padding and so.

Today I formatted the first paragraph with the proper color, size, font and paddings. I put the overall font-family and font-color in the css `body{}` so it applies to all the text I'm working with, and I have to adjust just the title ones to the specif color and font.

I had much difficult with the `<li>` tag cause I couldn't find how to format the text correctly, but I decide to continue the main topics and get back on that later on the project.

<ins>**18/11/2024**

I had only few minutes to work on this project today, so I decided to reorganize my `.css` with another approach based on the [best practices in CSS](https://www.notion.so/luhmestudos/BP-CSS-13f3c005826180018f15dcc9d35d6c7a) that I've studied these past days.

I also learn how to put a line between paragraphs using `<hr>`.

<ins>**20/11/2024**

I worked on the structure of this project, the style of titles, the table and `<p>` tag. Now I have to perfect some style details such as numbers on 'Instructions' section.

<ins>**21/11/2024**

I worked on the nutrition's table style. I had much trouble making only the bottom border appear, but I finally did it! I had to make every line of the table one table itself and, after that, put an `id` on the last "table/line" to make its border non existant. I think there's maybe a better way, but I couldn't find neither in my notes either online. I will search more deeply in the future.
