# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page

![Design preview for the Recipe page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luiza Moretti and I am starting on the world of Front-end!

Thanks for checking out this coding challenge. I've got it from Frontend Mentor website, so you should check it out too.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a given recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The design can be seen on the top of this page :P

## Where to find everything

All design used are inside the `/design` folder, both mobile and desktop verisons.

- All the assets required are in the `/assets` folder. 
- There are some font files in the `/assets` folder as well, but it is possible to incorporate google fonts.
- The `style-guide.md` file contains the information needed to complete the project, such as color palette and fonts.

## My timeline

<u>**14/11/2024**</u>
Since I am just starting to learn the basic tools to web development, I decided to use only HTML, CSS and JS. This can be changed at any time, and I will add here the changes as I go.

All the design images are in `.jpg` so I'll have to use my skills to build the page as similar as the given design as I can.

There is a `.HTML` file that contains a basic structure and the recipe itself.
I have decided to work from top to bottom on this project, so I analysed the design and the `.HTML` file to decide where to begin.
